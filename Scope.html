    <center><h2>Scope</h2></center>
    <p>The “5th International Symposium on Information Management in a Changing World” will take place in Antalya, Turkey, from November 24-26, 2014.  To commemorate the 2014 Turkish-German Science Year, IMCW2014 is organized in cooperation with Hacettepe University and the The Goethe-Institut in Turkey.</p>
    <p>IMCW2014 will be held jointly with the 10th International Conference on Knowledge Management (ICKM2014) at the same venue so that participants will have a chance to attend both events.</p>
    <p>Research and innovation (R&I) is the lifeblood of development.  Digital information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer tremendous opportunities to set up a truly global e-science infrastructure to foster research and innovation and facilitate sharing not only the research outputs but also the research data.  The EU countries will spend some 71 billion euro for research under the Horizon 2020 program.  An enourmous amount of research data gets created, collected, processed and analyzed during the research process and it has to be managed effectively.  As the life of research data is far longer than the research projects themselves, preservation of, access to and reuse of research data is of great importance.  Effective management of research data requires infrastructure and data repositories as well as policies and standards for metadata, interoperability, knowledge discovery and reuse.  It is estimated that the effective management of research data and opening up “big data” will save Europe about 150-300 billion euro annually.</p>
